i3status is a small program (about 1500 SLOC) for generating a status bar for
i3bar, dzen2, xmobar or similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient by
issuing a very small number of system calls, as one generally wants to update
such a status line every second. This ensures that even under high load, your
status bar is updated correctly. Also, it saves a bit of energy by not hogging
your CPU as much as spawning the corresponding amount of shell commands would.

This is an unofficial fork which adds MPD (Music Player Daemon) support.
